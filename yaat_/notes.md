all files : .yaatconstruct, .yaatEmbed, yaatfiles, must be in the same directory.

when calling yaat command, always be on the root dir, cause yaat will look for docs folder on the current working directory it was called in

yaat uses the unix based file format. = /dir/filename or ./dir/filename
