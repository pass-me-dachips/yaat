always be at the directory where you want to run yaat commands. yaat will not change your current working directory and will only take the base name + you cwd.

all files : .yaatconstruct, .yaatEmbed, yaatfiles, must be in the same directory.

always be on the root directory or 1 direcory back from docs dir when calling `yaat` command cause yaat checks for the docs directory as a child directpry of the cureent root dir
