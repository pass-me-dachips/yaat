always be at the directory where you want to run yaat commands. yaat will not change your current working directory and will only take the base name + you cwd.

all files : .yaatconstruct, .yaatEmbed, yaatfiles, must be in the same directory.

when calling yaat command, always be on the root dir, cause yaat will look for docs folder on the current working directory it was called in
